Let the Holy War begin!!!! Which one of provided pieces of Python code faster? shorter? Holywar will do the job and decide it in a brutal way!!!

The main purpose of holywar is to entertain people rather than arguing about which one of code block or programing tecnique is better.
It is strongly recommended to consider that actual code is being executed during holywar so use only trusted sources of rival codes and under any circumstances DO NOT upload rival codes from the Internet especially from unknown or untrusted sources!

Holywar is provided as is with no warranty or liability.
